# CustomCPPCommandHandler
A Custom Command Handler written in C++

## Initialize Project
This works directly on the start with a test command.
To pull this project use Visual Studio's GitHub plugin.

## Create a Command
Create a new c++ class and import the ``CommandLib.h`` file. Let your class extend from Command and build your constructor.
It needs to initialize the command constructor to make your command valid.

```c++
#include "CommandLib.h"
class ExampleCommand : public Command {
  ExampleCommand()
    : Command("example") // <--
      {}
};
```

Then create the call void function. It has a ``vector<string>`` parameter in wich are the arguments to the command.
You can now choose if you want to handle the arguments yourself or give it to the ArgumentList. This will automatically sort
your argument list to Argument Objects wich have an argument title and argument parameters. It will also check if the user
has written the string arguments right. Here is an example to the call function and argument list:

```c++
#include "CommandLib.h"
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class ExampleCommand : public Command {
  ExampleCommand()
    : Command("example")
      {}
      
    void call(std::vector<std::string> args) override {
      ArgumentList argList(args); // Argument string list get sorted into objects
      
      if (argList.noCll()) { // Checks if command spelling is right
          std::cout << "Command has false spelling." << std::endl;
        } else {
          Argument arg = findBoth("t", "test"); // Checks if command has a ``-t`` or ``--test`` parameter
          // For example you could get the arguments from the parameters with arg.getArg() wich would return a vector with strings
      }
    }
};
```
_More exact description to Argument List is coming soon_

## Register a Command
Commands are getting registered in the main.cpp file. They get passed to the CommandHandler which is then passed to the RunCmdBase function.
Keep the rythm to the first registration and the next commands are getting also registered.

## Simulated console
The simulated console opens if the program is in debug mode, the user clicks on the program or the user only types the command.
Commands are getting the same way executed but the user only needs to type the subcommands to execute them. Example on test command:<br><br>
**Normal Command**

``command test --test argument``

**Command in simulated console**

``test --test argument``
